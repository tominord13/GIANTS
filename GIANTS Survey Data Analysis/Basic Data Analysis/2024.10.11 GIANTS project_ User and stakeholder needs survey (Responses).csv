Information and training are essential to promote those types of vehicles. 
Experience shows indeed that even the competent public authorities at all levels (regional, national, European) do not know, for example, the difference between an L6 and an L7. 
For 99% of the population, it's the same: a light 4-wheel vehicle for urban use. 
While in practice, an L7 can often replace a car. Which is almost never the case with an L6 because of all its limitations in terms of speed and autonomy.

2. In addition to all kind of practical and comfort aspects, it is above all the purchase price that prevents individuals and companies from opting for this type of vehicle. 
As long as they do not benefit from substantial financial assistance that is more attractive than their automobile counterparts, the population will continue to buy cars. 
This concerns taxes, insurance, and especially purchase premiums for urban citizens with low incomes who still need a vehicle to do their shopping, to go to work, to drive a child to school, to go to a medical appointment, to transport an elderly person, etc.

In conclusion, promotion/information and financial support for this vehicle is essential",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
